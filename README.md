# Purpose
This repo proposes a **bootstrap for an Express REST API backend** written in **Typescript** and tested with **Jest + Ponicode + Supertest**. It is served by a MongoDB.

You can find the full bootstrap repo [here](https://github.com/losikov/api-example.git).

- ExpressJS with Typescript as the server
- OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger for the API definition
- swagger-routes-express to generate express routes based on OpenAPI specification
- Morgan and Winston for logging management
- MongoDB with Mongoose for the DB management
